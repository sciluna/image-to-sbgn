  firstSampleComment: "This diagram represents a pathway with 9 nodes and 8 edges. 9 nodes include 5 simple chemicals, 2 macromolecules, and 2 processes. 8 edges include 3 consumption, 3 production, and 2 modulation edges. The process node in the left consumes glucose and ATP, and produces glucose 6P and ADP while hexokinase modulates (represented with modulation edge) the process. The process node in the right consumes glucose 6P and produces fructose 6P while glucose-6P isomerase modulates (represented with modulation edge) the process. In the light of this information, generate the SBGNML for this hand-drawn SBGN diagram. Make sure that each element in the resulting SBGNML has the correct tag, this is very inportant. Please also make sure that each glyph has a label and bbox subtags and each arc has source and target defined as attribute inside arc tag (not as subtags). Take your time and act with careful consideration. Do NOT enclose the JSON output in markdown code blocks like ```json and make sure that you are returning a valid JSON (this is important).",
  secondSampleComment: "This diagram represents a pathway with 13 nodes and 9 edges. 13 nodes include 6 simple chemicals, 2 macromolecules, 2 processes, 2 complexes, and 1 compartment. 9 edges include 4 consumption, 3 production, 1 modulation, and 1 stimulation edges. The process node in the left consumes FAD and HX-CoA, and produces trans-Hex-2-enoyl-CoA and FADH2 while a complex node holding a macromolecule (ACADS) inside modulates (represented with modulation edge) the process. The process node in the right consumes trans-Hex-2-enoyl-CoA and H2O, and produces (S)-Hydroxyhexanoyl-CoA while a complex node holding a macromolecule (ECHS1) inside stimulates (represented with stimulation edge) the process.

  thirdSampleComment: "This diagram represents a pathway with 16 nodes and 11 edges. 16 nodes include 3 macromolecules (STAT1a, STAT1a and IRF1), 4 nucleic acid features (IRF1-GAS, IRF1-GAS, IRF1 and IRF1), 2 processes, 3 complexes, 2 empty sets, 1 association, and 1 and node. 11 edges include 4 consumption, 3 production, 2 necessary stimulation and 2 logic arcs. In the top left, macromolecule STAT1a is inside a complex node. That complex node and nucleic acid feature (IRF1-GAS) are input to association node, and the output of the association is another complex. Inside the output complex, there is a nucleic acid feature (IRF1-GAS) and another complex node holding a macromolecule (STAT1a). Then, the output complex and nucleic acid feature IRF1 become input to AND node. Please note that the input edges to AND node are logic arcs. The AND node is connected to a process node via a necessary stimulation edge. That process node gets an empty set node as input and produces nucleic acid feature IRF1. That IRF1 is connected to another process via necessary stimulation edge. That process also takes an empty set as input and produces macromolecule IRF1.

  forthSampleComment: "This diagram represents a pathway with 40 nodes and 30 edges. 40 nodes include 3 macromolecules (PNPO, PDXK and AOX1), 3 complexes, 1 compartment, 6 processes and 27 simple chemicals. 30 edges include 14 consumption, 13 production, and 3 modulation edges. Each macromolecule is inside a complex node. Compartment cytosol contains all other nodes. In the light of this information, generate the SBGNML for this hand-drawn SBGN diagram.
